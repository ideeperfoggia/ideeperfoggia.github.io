Palazzo De Vita has had several owners over the centuries[^1]; it once belonged to the ancient De Maio family, who already owned other buildings in the city, as well as burial places in the church of San Domenico in Foggia, in the Church of Gesù in Naples, and in the Church of Santa Maria di Foggia (today's cathedral). Some members of the family served as *reggimentari* and *mastrogiurati* up until the late 17th century, the century in which the family became extinct in the city. The palace then passed to the Calvanese family, who were already documented as the owners of the property by 1668. They too had several family members among the city’s *reggimentari* and *mastrogiurati*, but the most notable was Girolamo Calvanese, a canon and the author of *Memorie per la città di Foggia* (a manuscript written in 1720), one of the earliest historical works on the city of Foggia. Ownership of the property then passed to the Monastery of Santa Chiara, which later sold it to Giuseppe De Vita. Between the 18th and 19th centuries, the property came into the hands of the Celetano family, one of the city's most prominent families at the time, whose memory is still honored by an inscription placed next to the portal.

The building dates back to 1545; it underwent several renovations, especially during the 17th century—a difficult time for the people of Foggia, who suffered a devastating plague in 1659 that caused over a thousand deaths out of a population of about seven thousand. For fear of contagion, corpses were left in mass graves outside the city walls, often without any form of identification.

In the same year, the Foggia area experienced a terrible locust invasion that destroyed most of the wheat crops. Just a few years earlier, between 1647 and 1648, Palazzo De Vita had witnessed the uprising led by Sabato Pastore. These revolts in Foggia began in the same year as the more famous Neapolitan riots led by Masaniello. They were sparked by episodes of corruption and misconduct involving the city’s rulers, including officials of the Dogana. This was compounded by widespread discontent among the population, fueled by rising bread prices, high taxes, and—above all—the fact that most of the grain produced in Foggia was being sent to Naples, the voracious capital of the Kingdom. In 1647, a popular uprising took place, which the *doganiere* (customs officer) attempted to quell through amnesties and tax repeals. In 1648, another violent revolt erupted among the Dogana tenants protesting against the noble cereal producers; during this event, a man known as "Mattitone" was killed. The incident caused great alarm among the authorities, who fled, including the Governor of the Dogana, Simon Vaaz, Count of Mola, who sought refuge in Manfredonia. It was then that notary Giovanni Sabato Pastore took control of the Dogana, becoming the leader of the revolt. The so-called "Most Serene Republic of Sabato Pastore" lasted for about three months before being suppressed by the authorities.

Tommaso De Santis writes in *Istoria del tumulto di Napoli*, published in Naples in 1770, that Palazzo De Vita (then De Maio) was used by the rebels as a base to organize a guard corps against the Foggian *Reggimentario* and the ousted authorities:

> With Foggia left to the will of the rebels, they sought new ways to advance the armed uprising, spreading rumors that Don Francesco D’Avalos, along with many surrounding barons, had united and were planning to attack Foggia, threatening a great massacre […] they elected Notary Giovanni Sabato Pastore […] and on the thirteenth day of January, having all gathered at the Church of the Annunciata, they decided to repair the city walls, build gates, including one called the ‘Great Gate’, and formed three companies and as many guard corps—one at the said gate, guarded by foreigners and merchants; another at the house of Annibale di Majo, in the square by the Cathedral, guarded by citizens and gentlemen […] [^2].

A drawing of the city of Foggia, dating back to the 16th century and currently preserved in the Biblioteca Angelica in Rome, does not yet appear to show our Palazzo. In the map, the anonymous author takes care to mark the noble residences and places of worship. In the area where the Palazzo would later rise, around 1545, only modest popular dwellings with gabled roofs and three more prominent buildings with internal courtyards are visible; however, none of these are indicated as patrician residences.
